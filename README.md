## Hi there 👋 - Can't believe you're stalking me.
## Are you seriously expecting my help in doing so?
## Alright, but just this once... ok??
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him
- 💬 Ask me about my religion. I started my own, abbreviated [HPFC](https://github.com/spookyahell/higher-power-fan-club). - Can be searched on [bing.com](https://www.bing.com/search?q=hpfc+higher+power+fan+club+github) - Waiting for members. <br><em>It's just me for now.</em>
- 🔭 Mostly working on a lot of individual projects that are not (yet) on GitHub (Some of them will never be)
- 🐍 Favorite programming language: The snake. (Python3 is nice, or simply "python" on Windows)
- ⭐️ Favorite mobile OS: Kinda a tough call. Both iOS and Android have their perks; however...
- 🤖 Android (especially any version prior V.10) is the mobile OS everyone should be on, if there was only one to choose for eternity.
- 🚫 Not a fan of security forcefully improving on mobile devices with the claim of improving security, when we all know NSA has proprietary backdoors anyway. (Possibly. Probably.)
- 👀 NSA needs to have a look at my new data encoding algorithm, over at [gist](https://gist.github.com/spookyahell/eb8f8c11b8129ccfdea73cd23a7bf304)
- 📄 Encoding bin data blobs to emojis is an ongoing obsession, it offers endless oppertunities. - And still no decoding script for now... not from me anyway.

## I've done some interesting things in the past though...

I infamously own the only youtube-dl repository that was re-instated "as-is"..
<br>after the RIAA falsely claimed they were entitled to take it down (among the other copies).
<br>After the repo was re-instated I started adding music video links to YouTube in the README.md file
<br>to show "I can list whatever videos wherever I want to".

<strong>RIAA can suck it.</strong>

### That's not all... that's not all.
I've also written most of the code for [pyOneFichierClient](https://github.com/spookyahell/pyOneFichierClient).
<br>That happend "back in the day"... when I was more involved with 1fichier than I am now.

#### Semi-interesting web-projects currently run by me
- [ton-dns.com](https://ton-dns.com) / [ton-dns.de](https://ton-dns.de) & more to add to that list
- [fck.kids](https://github.com/spookyahell/fck.kids) (not yet live)
- more planned
