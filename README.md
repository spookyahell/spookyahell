## Hi there üëã - Can't believe you're stalking me.
## Are you seriously expecting my help in doing so?
## Alright, but just this once... ok??
- üòÑ Pronouns: He/him
- üí¨ Ask me about my religion. I started my own, abbreviated [HPFC](https://github.com/spookyahell/higher-power-fan-club). - Can be searched on [bing.com](https://www.bing.com/search?q=hpfc+higher+power+fan+club+github) - Waiting for members. <br><em>It's just me for now.</em>
- üî≠ Mostly working on a lot of individual projects that are not (yet) on GitHub (Some of them will never be)
- üêç Favorite programming language: The snake. (Python3 is nice, or simply "python" on Windows)
- ‚≠êÔ∏è Favorite mobile OS: Kinda a tough call. Both iOS and Android have their perks; however...
- ü§ñ Android (especially any version prior V.10) is the mobile OS everyone should be on, if there was only one to choose for eternity.
- üö´ Not a fan of security forcefully improving on mobile devices with the claim of improving security, when we all know NSA has proprietary backdoors anyway. (Possibly. Probably.)
- üëÄ NSA needs to have a look at my new data encoding algorithm, over at [gist](https://gist.github.com/spookyahell/eb8f8c11b8129ccfdea73cd23a7bf304)
- üìÑ Encoding bin data blobs to emojis is an ongoing obsession, it offers endless oppertunities. - And still no decoding script for now... not from me anyway.

## I've done some interesting things in the past though...

I infamously own the only youtube-dl repository that was re-instated "as-is"..
<br>after the RIAA falsely claimed they were entitled to take it down (among the other copies).
<br>After the repo was re-instated I started adding music video links to YouTube in the README.md file
<br>to show "I can list whatever videos wherever I want to".

<strong>RIAA can suck it.</strong>

### That's not all... that's not all.
Hard to believe... but [WinSpotlightCopy](https://github.com/spookyahell/WinSpotlightCopy) (previously "Win10SpotlightCopy") still works on Windows 11.
<br>I wrote it 6 years ago, when I was knew to Windows 10.
<br>I myself haven't used it much recently, only recently started using a computer again, now with Windows 11.

Speaking of projects that are ancient (6 years old)..
<br>[cmd-lyrics](https://github.com/spookyahell/cmd-lyrics) is a possession I'm kinda proud of.
<br>Forget the dedicated <a href="https://minilyrics.com/" target="_blank">MiniLyrics</a> application, this is the real way to open a .lrc file.

I've also written most of the code for [pyOneFichierClient](https://github.com/spookyahell/pyOneFichierClient).
<br>That happend "back in the day"... when I was more involved with 1fichier than I am now.

#### Semi-interesting web-projects currently run by me
- [ton-dns.com](https://ton-dns.com) / [ton-dns.de](https://ton-dns.de) & more to add to that list
- [fck.kids](https://github.com/spookyahell/fck.kids) (not yet live)
- more planned

### Interesting projects around health care
I was tracking COVID19 injections data by our local government and came accross weird shit.
<br>Data was ammended or updated or whatever you call it MONTHS later. (That doesn't seem right!)

### Interesting projects around politics
I believe politcs could be a fuck of a lot simpler if people used modern communication tools such as github.com to communicate their issues.
<br>Of course there would have to be community managers. But lets say the county and the city you live in both have such a repo and an active issue tracker.
‚Äî You can report issues, they can have templates for the issues. And everyone can live a simpler life. Politicians can get involved if they wanna. Local ones, of course.
‚Äî The president could join in if necessary... but usually it shouldn't be necessary. Even the mayor wouldn't ever be needed if volunteers would do more.
‚Äî A town needs volunteers... it doesn't work any other way. The volunteers need to help keep the place clean (but not just that). Help elderly people. With technology. With whatever they need.

- [berlin-politics](https://github.com/spookyahell/berlin-politics) is here.
- [de-politics](https://github.com/spookyahell/de-politics) is here.

Advanced technology is already available.
So... why isn't it being used properly? ‚Äî 
The European Union should have their own issues system. ‚Äî I might launch one for them, an unofficial one.
<br>Let ALL people be part of the system. Take responsibility. Make a good system, have people use strong authentification.
<br>Participation only through identification? IDK... Why not?
<br>Why are people afraid to use their real identity? - If it's government operated, it should be fine.
<br>As fine as it can possibly be. - You need to be able to have trust in a few things.

In a perfect world you'd have a voting system where users can at least voice their concerns about a new idea publicly for all to read.
<br>People can review those comments and maybe we need to use A.I. to check if people even understood the comments... and of course A.I. will also make sure it correctly understands the intention of the OP.
<br>A.I. can be useful and some people have proven to not be smarter than A.I., sadly. .. however, maybe it's best to keep A.I. out of our lives as much as still possible.

Best practice? IDK...

## Need to pace myself
...with the domain registrations.
Because of monetary resources.

Feel free to help me out, any help is greatly appreciated.
